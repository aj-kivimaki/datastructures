# Assignment 2

Bubble sort / Selection sort are simplest sorting algorithms.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

## Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. a textbox where user inputs array and sorting is done according to these items or you can also manually insert array values inside code
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI
- Use any of the sorting algorithms alternative to bubble sort or selection sort (i.e. mergesort, quick sort and radix sort)
- Optional: use both or more than one sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble and selection sort)

# Assignment 3

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)

## Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. one button that shows pushing items to stack and another button that shows poping items out of stack
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI

# Assignment 4

Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and
the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)

OPTIONAL TASK: THIS IS OPTIONAL TASK (as there is already Snake game group work)

## Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. one button that shows enqueue items to queue and another button that shows dequeue items out of queue
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI
